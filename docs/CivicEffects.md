# Civic effect audit

Reviewed against the requested five-column civic table on 2026-10-08.
All effects below have implementation paths in XML, C++, or Python, and are
described in civic help. This is a source and asset audit; it does not replace
an in-game or multiplayer check.

## Details and boundaries

- Civic stability is determined by bounded combination bonuses/penalties;
  see [CivicStability.md](CivicStability.md) for the complete rules. Individual
  civic weights and the legacy market/planned-economy crises have been removed.
- Only the religion column enables a state religion. Theocracy in the legitimacy
  column applies its building and combat bonuses without enabling a state
  religion independently or implying that other legitimacy civics prohibit one.
- Normal citizens remain the fallback for idle population under self-sufficiency.
  Assigned specialists are removed upon adoption; free specialists use separate
  counters and are retained.
- Improvement growth covers every upgrade stage of cottages. Serfdom's commerce
  penalty applies to the village improvement, as specified in the original table.
- Democracy uses the synchronized game RNG and only selects columns with an
  available alternative. If no other column has an available alternative, nothing
  changes. Elections occur on global turn multiples of ten.
- Democracy's old temporary transition instability has been removed. Its election
  effect is displayed once through the civic's XML Help entry.
- Production bonuses from dictatorship and nationalism now add together through
  the standard yield modifier rather than a shared conditional bonus.
- Religious buildings are identified by `ReligionType` or `PrereqReligion`.
  Atheism removes/restores cached local and global building effects on adoption
  and departure; buildings remain owned and still count toward wonder limits.
  Suppression also covers obsolete-safe building culture, shrine income, free
  specialists and great person generation.
- Existing religions remain under atheism, including when a city changes owners.
  Founding or relocating a holy city is preserved as a separate game action;
  ordinary religion spread, including event and Python calls, is blocked.
- Changing XML civic modifiers affects cached player/city data. Start a new game
  when checking these changes; an older save may retain earlier cached bonuses.

## Asset checks

`python tools/audit_civic_assets.py` checks all loaded text entries for all five
languages, the 25 civic definitions, their description/help keys and civic IDs
referenced by XML and the changed C++ files. The civic XML was additionally checked with
MSXML 3.0 against its XDR schema. Python event code was syntax checked using the
bundled Python 2.4 interpreter and universal-newline input.

Custom help uses one `[ICON_BULLET]` per effect, `[NEWLINE]` between effects and
the Civ4 production, happiness, unhappiness, culture and strength symbol macros.
Standard XML effects retain the game's standard generated help.
