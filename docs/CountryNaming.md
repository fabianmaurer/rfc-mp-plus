# Dynamic country names

Independent countries use named civic types in `CvPlayer::processCivNames()`.
The rule names below are internal categories, not compulsory words in the
displayed name. Several civic combinations deliberately share a natural name:
India remains the Kingdom of India under Rule of Law, for example. Names are
authored individually rather than assembled from civic modifiers. Historical
identities are mixed with plausible alternate histories; this is a roleplaying
catalogue, not a reconstruction of each state's dates, borders, or dynasty.
Existing vassal and colonial names retain priority. The new names are stored as
translation keys, using the existing RFC name setter and save format.

Rules are evaluated in this order:

| Condition | Name family |
| --- | --- |
| Tribal System without a religious government | Tribal Confederation |
| State religion and Holy State or Theocratic Legitimacy | Holy Kingdom, Theocracy, or Theocratic Republic according to government; Islamic rulers use Caliphate or Islamic Republic |
| Monarchy, Islam, and State Religion | Sultanate |
| Monarchy and Rule of Law | Constitutional Kingdom |
| Other monarchies | Kingdom up to six cities; Empire above six cities |
| Planned Economy with Democracy | Democratic Socialist Republic |
| Planned Economy with Republic | Socialist Republic |
| Planned Economy with Dictatorship | People's State |
| Dictatorship and Nationalism | National State |
| Other dictatorships with Professional Army or Conscription | Military Government |
| Other dictatorships | State |
| Republic or Democracy with State Atheism | Secular Republic |
| Republic or Democracy with Islam and State Religion | Islamic Republic |
| Republic or Democracy with Plutocracy | Merchant Republic |
| Republic or Democracy with Nationalism | National Republic |
| Other Republic or Democracy | Republic or Democratic Republic |

Religious naming requires an actual state religion. A professional army alone
does not make a democracy a military government. Planned Economy does not turn
a monarchy into a republic. Constitutional monarchies keep their name at any
size. Religion and economics take priority over nationalism when both apply.

Country-specific alternatives include the Hanseatic League, Middle Kingdom,
Commonwealth of England, Batavian Republic, Novgorod Republic, North Sea Empire,
Tawantinsuyu, and the United Kingdom. Invented alternatives include the Nile
League, League of the Jade Cities, Andean Federation, and Union of Bharat.
Germany uses the Holy Roman Empire for a Christian religious monarchy. Rome
uses the Papal States for a Christian religious government which is not a
Republic or Democracy. Other state religions use the ordinary country entries.

Civic changes and conversions refresh names through the original event hooks.
Names also refresh once per player turn, including in existing saves. Existing
pre-spawn names, country short names, and nationality adjectives use the original
RFC text. Name selection does not depend on UI language or random numbers.

`CountryNames.csv` lists 569 entries representing 330 distinct English/German
name pairs. Repeated entries are intentional. The new text
file is `Assets/XML/Text/CIV4GameText_RFCMP_CountryNames.xml`. All five Civ4 language
elements are present; French, Italian, and Spanish use English fallbacks.

To maintain the translations, edit `tools/country_name_catalog.py` and run
`tools/generate_country_names.py` with development Python 3. It generates the XML
using numeric Unicode entities for compatibility with Civ4's XML reader.
